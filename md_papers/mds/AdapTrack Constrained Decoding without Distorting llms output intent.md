Abstract
Language model-based code generation and completion tools have
been widely adopted, but they may sometimes produce code that
does not meet necessary constraints, such as syntactic correctness
or API existence. Constrained decoding techniques are developed
to help the model generate code that adheres to the constraints
by greedily eliminating generation options that violate constraints
at each step of the generation process. However, there is a severe
limitation of constrained decoding, that it distorts the model’s out-
put intent, forcing it to produce code that may satisfy the con-
straint but does not match the development intent and is therefore
incorrect. In response to this challenge, we propose AdapTrack.
By incorporating backtracking into the generation process, Adap-
Track avoids distorting the output intent of the language model,
thereby producing results that are not only constraint-compliant
but also more semantically aligned with model’s output intent.
On our synthetic API completion dataset, AdapTrack can achieve
up to 360.87% improvement compared to constrained decoding;
on the real-world API completion dataset we collect that exhibits
similar issues, AdapTrack can also achieve an improvement of up
to 38.93% over constrained decoding; in general code genration
benchmarks, compared to constrained decoding, AdapTrack can
achieve up to 7.84% improvement on HumanEval, and up to 6.42%
improvement on MBPP. This indicates that, simply by better adher-
ing to the model’s output intent, AdapTrack can achieve significant
improvements. We provide a theoretical proof that the distribution
produced by AdapTrack aligns with the model’s distribution given
the generated tokens, thereby ensuring that the model’s output
intent is not distorted. Experiments on domain-specific language
problems show that, compared to existing methods, our approach
can provide generation results that are more consistent with the
language model’s distribution.

Introduction
In recent years, language model-based code generation and comple-
tion tools, such as GitHub Copilot [13], have become increasingly

popular. These tools can understand the developer’s intent from the
context and generate code that aligns with their intent by leveraging
the capabilities of the language models [2, 10, 18, 20, 23].
Legitimate code must satisfy various constraints, such as adher-
ing to syntax rules and ensuring that the called APIs exist. Language
models are designed solely to predict the distribution of the next
token [30, 33], but lack built-in mechanisms to guarantee that the
generated code complies with these constraints. As a result, the gen-
erated code, while potentially aligned with the developer’s intent,
may sometimes be illegitimate.
Constrained decoding methods [3, 29, 32, 35] are developed to
tackle such problems. Using a constrainer to identify tokens ille-
gal to come after already generated text, it simply eliminates the
possibility to generate these illegal tokens by directly setting their
probability to zero in the model’s output distribution. Such con-
strainers are often available [3, 35], because the Integrated Devel-
opment Environment (IDE) often provides developers with similar
functionality during their development.
However, there is a severe limitation of constrained decod-
ing[4, 22, 27], that it distorts the output intent of the model and
forces the model to produce unnatural code. In other words, the gen-
erated code, while satisfying the constraints, may deviate from the
model’s expected functionality and fail to align with the contextual
semantics. Figure 1 shows an example to explain this limitation. The
input code context is shown in Figure 1a. The user wants to calculate
the rank of a matrix using PyTorch [6] 2.0. Two APIs can accomplish
this task: torch.matrix_rank for PyTorch 1.0 to PyTorch 1.8, and
torch.linalg.matrix_rank for PyTorch after 1.8. Depending on
the user’s PyTorch version, the model needs to select the appropri-
ate API. Figure 1b shows the API names the model intends to output,
along with their corresponding probabilities. Its top candidate is
matrix_rank, and second candidate is linalg.matrix_rank. Us-
ing a constrainer, it becomes clear that the only legal API in the
current version is linalg.matrix_rank. Ideally, since we have
prohibited the now-illegal matrix_rank by constrained decoding,
the decoding process should most likely output the most possible
candidate under constraint, i.e. linalg.matrix_rank. However, as
shown in Figure 1c, the API with the highest generation probability

(d) What happened during the constrained decoding.
Figure 1: An example of incorrect decoding results in constrained decoding.
in constrained decoding is actually matrix_power at 57.70%! This
is entirely unexpected because, without constrained decoding, the
generation probability of matrix_power is only 0.20%, indicating
that the model considers it highly unsuitable for this context. How
does this API suddenly become the top choice under constrained
decoding?
Let us examine the constrained decoding process step by step,
as illustrated in Figure 1d. In the first time step, the legal options in-
clude matrix, l, and several other less possible tokens. Since there
are other valid APIs starting with matrix, such as matrix_power
and matrix_exp, the constrainer does not eliminate the possibil-
ity of generating matrix. As a result, the model still chooses the
token matrix with a probability of 60.46%. However, once matrix
and the subsequent _ token are generated, we find that the token
rank, which accounts for 99.59% of the model’s generation intent, is
prohibited by the constrainer. At this point, since the model has al-
ready generated matrix_, it is forced to continue under constrained
decoding, leading it to select the token power, which is entirely
misaligned with its output intent. Consequently, even though the
model knows that, aside from matrix_rank, the most appropriate
output here should be linalg.matrix_rank, constrained decoding
compels it to output matrix_power with a 57.70% probability – an
answer the model considers highly incorrect.
We observe that, in the process described above, the model is
ultimately forced to select an API that is entirely misaligned
with its generation intent. The constrainer can only identify
errors one step at a time, so the matrix option remains valid. How-
ever, when we realize that the model’s primary intent is thwarted
later, we are still compelled to continue generating based on the
previously produced tokens, i.e. matrix_. As a result, the generated
code, while satisfying the constraints, deviates from the model’s
original output intent.
If a human were writing this code and discovered that the previ-
ously used API matrix_rank was no longer available, but recalled
having seen the API linalg.matrix_rank, they would typically
delete the previously written matrix_ and start over again. Inspired
by this behavior, we wonder if a similar mechanism could be in-
troduced into constrained decoding, allowing the model to quickly
backtrack to a point where it might have gone wrong and start
anew when encountering such difficulties.
Based on this idea, we propose AdapTrack, which, during the
constrained decoding process, dynamically backtracks according
to the proportion of invalid options among the current next-
step choices. If this proportion is large, it indicates that the model
is unlikely to want to continue generating along this branch and
should switch to another branch; otherwise, it suggests that most of
the model’s output intent remains on this branch, and we can pro-
ceed with generation. In this way, we address the aforementioned
issue by dynamically backtracking to avoid generating results that
deviate too far from the model’s intent under constraints.
We provide proof for our algorithm, demonstrating that the
distribution it produces is identical to the model’s distribution under
constraints given the known generation history. This proves that
our method effectively avoids the issue of constrained decoding
distorting the model’s generation intent, achieving generation that
is both constraint-compliant and aligned with the model’s intent.
To demonstrate that AdapTrack does address the issue we raised
in Figure 1 – using unfamiliar APIs correctly with a constrainer, we
construct a synthetic dataset, TFv1, based on the update in Tensor-
Flow [1] APIs, deliberately prompting the model to use APIs that
are unique to TensorFlow v1. These v1 APIs are still usable in Ten-
sorFlow v2, except that they have a longer prefix. Since the model
is unaware of the TensorFlow version, its output intent inherently
includes options for both versions. By using the constrainer, we

examine whether the model can generate these APIs compliant
with TensorFlow v1 or v2. The results show that, across multiple
code language models, AdapTrack significantly improves API gen-
eration accuracy compared to naive constrained decoding, with an
improvement of up to 360.87%.
To ensure that these results are not merely effective on this
synthetic dataset, we construct a dataset, TFv1Real, based on real-
world usage examples of these APIs on GitHub, and ask the model
to complete the API given the preceding context. The results on
this dataset show that AdapTrack achieves up to 38.93% improve-
ment over constrained decoding, once again demonstrating the
effectiveness of AdapTrack.
To verify this issue’s presence and AdapTrack’s generalizability
in constrained decoding of general code generation, we conduct ex-
periments on HumanEval [10] and MBPP [7] with type constrainer
[26]. The results show that AdapTrack can achieve up to 7.84%
improvement on HumanEval, and up to 6.42% improvement on
MBPP, showing the generalizability of AdapTrack.
To demonstrate that the generation results of our method are
indeed more aligned with the model’s output intent, we conduct
experiments on domain-specific language problems, sampling 2000
results for each problem consecutively and comparing them with
2000 results by previous approaches. The results show that the
distribution produced by our method has a significantly lower KL
divergence from the correct distribution, compared to existing meth-
ods, indicating that it better aligns with the actual distribution.
We also conduct robustness analysis on temperature and model
size to ensure AdapTrack works with different hyperparameters.
Due to potential concerns of efficiency and scalability, we conduct
experiments with limited backtrack distance, showing that a certain
short-range backtracking is enough on TFv1 and TFv1Real.
In summary, our contributions are as follows.
• We propose AdapTrack, a constrained decoding method that
can avoid distortion of the model’s output intent in greedy
constrained decoding.
• We prove that AdapTrack’s distribution aligns with the model’s
distribution given the generated tokens. Experiments on DSL
problems show that the distribution produced by AdapTrack
aligns closer with the model’s true intent.
• We construct the TFv1 and TFv1Real datasets to simulate
scenarios where the model is unfamiliar with APIs. The
results demonstrate that our method significantly improves
the accuracy of API generation, with an improvement up to
360.87% on TFv1 and 38.93% on TFv1Real. Experiments on
HumanEval and MBPP demonstrate the generalizability of
AdapTrack in general code generation.

Motivating example
We have seen the problem of constrained decoding in Figure 1. The
problem occurs when the decoding process eliminates the proba-
bility of one API, but fails to generate another highly possible API
with a different prefix. We propose to introduce backtracking into
the decoding process as a potential solution, and in this section we
will delve into a more comprehensive discussion of this approach.
Figure 2 shows step by step how to utilize this intuition to mod-
ify the constrained decoding process. The arrows between tokens
represent the generation order. A solid arrow indicates that the
current state of generation includes this step, whereas a dashed
arrow signifies other potential generation options. A red dashed
box denotes tokens that are invalid in the current context, and a
green solid box represents valid tokens. The numbers on the to-
kens indicate their conditional generation probabilities given the
preceding context.
Figure 2a illustrates the scenario where the issue mentioned in
Figure 1 occurs. At this point, we have generated matrix_, and
subsequently identified the following token options, their validity,
and how much the language model wants to generate them. We
observe that the model has a 99.59% probability to generate the
invalid rank token.
We now consider the overall probability of the sequence from
the first token up to each candidate option, as shown in Figure 2b.
For example, the probability of the model generating matrix_rank
is roughly 60.21%. After eliminating invalid options, we can renor-
malize the probabilities of all remaining valid options. This process
ensures that all valid options experience an equivalent proportional
increase in their probabilities.
We can reorganize the probabilities, resulting in Figure 2c. The
probability of matrix has decreased from 60.46% to 0.55%, which
aligns more closely with our intuition that, after learning that the
top candidate matrix_rank is invalid, the model should aim to
generate the second candidate, which does not begin with matrix.
This happens because we have performed a global probability ad-
justment after eliminating the invalid option matrix_rank, thereby
allowing the probability of matrix to correctly decrease.
Now we want to backtrack and change the initial choice of
matrix, so that we can follow the output intent of the model to
not generate matrix and circumvent the limitation of constrained
decoding. But now comes the question: given that we have already
generated matrix with a probability of 60.46%, how can we adjust
this probability to 0.55%? One option is to directly resample. In
practice, however, this would imply that we would resample the
entire sequence regardless of how minor the new error identified
by the constrainer is, which would be wasteful of time and com-
putational resources. We have an intuition that if the probability
change is substantial, we are likely inclined to depart from this
branch; otherwise, we probably wish to remain within the same
branch.
To formalize this intuition, we propose the use of rejection sam-
pling for adaptive backtracking, as shown in Figure 2d. We have
generated matrix with a probability of 60.46%. We can perform a
second sampling with an acceptance rate of roughly 0.91%. If the
sampling succeeds, we can continue to use matrix; otherwise, we
switch to another token. Thus, by combining the results of the two
sampling processes, we achieve a sampling outcome where matrix
is adopted with a probability of 0.55%.
After this resampling, one possible result is shown in Figure 2e,
where the first token is changed to l. This directs us towards the
generation of the second candidate, linalg.matrix_rank.

Goal
We have demonstrated, by example, that the output of constrained
decoding can be far away from the model’s intent, which can be
shown by the large difference between the probability distribution
of constrained decoding and that of the language model.
To keep the output aligned with the model’s intent, the best
option is to perfectly align with the probability distribution of the
language model while keeping the constraints. In this subsection,
we will formalize this goal.
Given a context 𝑠<𝑖, an autoregressive language model can pro-
duce a distribution over the next token 𝑃(𝑠𝑖|𝑠<𝑖). This allows us
to define a distribution over all possible sequences, i.e., the joint
probability distribution of the entire sequence,
𝑃(𝑠0, . . . ,𝑠𝑛) =
𝑛
Ö
𝑖=0
𝑃(𝑠𝑖|𝑠<𝑖).
A constrainer is a function defined on a sequence 𝑐: 𝑠↦→{0, 1},
where the result is 0 if all sequences that start with this sequence
as their prefix is invalid, and 1 otherwise. We use 𝐶(𝑠) = {𝑡|𝑐(𝑠::
[𝑡]) = 1} to represent all valid tokens after the prefix 𝑠.
Our task is to define a distribution 𝑃𝑐over all valid sequences,
such that the probability of generating any sequence is proportional
to its probability under the language model. This can be formally
expressed as follows,
𝑃(𝑠|𝑐) ∝𝑃(𝑠)𝑐(𝑠), ∀𝑠that is complete.
Or equivalently, for any two valid complete sequences 𝑠and 𝑠′,
we should have the following property,
𝑃(𝑠|𝑐)
𝑃(𝑠′|𝑐) = 𝑃(𝑠)
𝑃(𝑠′) .

3.2
Constrained decoding and its problem
Constrained decoding is an ad-hoc modification of rejection sam-
pling, where illegal options are directly removed during the sam-
pling process. Specifically, instead of repeatedly sampling and dis-
carding invalid sequences, constrained decoding eliminates invalid
options at each step, ensuring that only valid tokens are considered
for generation.
Consider the generation probability of a valid sequence 𝑠=
(𝑠0, . . . ,𝑠𝑛) under constrained decoding. At each step of sampling 𝑠𝑖,
the probability can be viewed as a form of rejection sampling, where
the probability of sampling 𝑠𝑖given the prefix 𝑠<𝑖is normalized over
all valid continuations. Specifically, the probability of sampling 𝑠𝑖
is given by the following equation,
𝑃con(𝑠𝑖| 𝑠<𝑖) ∝𝑃(𝑠𝑖| 𝑠<𝑖)⟦𝑠𝑖∈𝐶(𝑠<𝑖)⟧,
𝑃con(𝑠𝑖| 𝑠<𝑖) = 𝑃(𝑠𝑖| 𝑠<𝑖)⟦𝑠𝑖∈𝐶(𝑠<𝑖)⟧
Í
𝑡∈𝐶(𝑠<𝑖) 𝑃(𝑡| 𝑠<𝑖)

When compared to the equation 1, the second term in the prod-
uct, which depends on the sums over 𝐶(𝑠<𝑖) and 𝐶(𝑠′
<𝑖), cannot
be canceled out. This shows that the generation probabilities of
sequences under constrained decoding are distorted relative to their
original language model probabilities.

AdapTrack
After defining our goal and necessary notations in section 3, we
can now describe our algorithm AdapTrack. Overall, our algorithm
keeps track of the validity of all known incomplete sequences and
maintains a sample for each prefix based on the validity information.
Our algorithm repeatedly samples an incomplete sequence and
collects the validity information into the sample. We compare the
validity information before and after this sampling and perform
rejection sampling to correct the samples for each prefix. When the
rejection happens, our algorithm will next time select a different
token on this prefix. This is equivalent to backtracking, because
we no longer use the same partially generation sequence.
Let us start from the beginning. We want to sample the distribu-
tion 𝑃(𝑠|𝑐), which can be decomposed as a series of sampling from
𝑃(𝑠𝑖|𝑐,𝑠<𝑖) as follows,
𝑃(𝑠|𝑐) =
Ö
𝑖
𝑃(𝑠𝑖|𝑐,𝑠<𝑖).
𝑃(𝑠𝑖|𝑐,𝑠<𝑖) can be decomposed by the Bayesian rule as follows,
𝑃(𝑠𝑖|𝑐,𝑠<𝑖) ∝𝑃(𝑠𝑖|𝑠<𝑖)𝑃(𝑐|𝑠<𝑖:: [𝑠𝑖]).
For every prefix 𝑥, we define our current estimation of 𝑃(𝑐|𝑥) as
𝑄[𝑥], where 𝑄is an associative array. We call a prefix 𝑥is new if
we have not calculated 𝑃(·|𝑥); otherwise we call it old. If the prefix
𝑥is invalid, 𝑄[𝑥] should be 0; otherwise, if 𝑥is old, which means we
know possible valid sequences starting from 𝑥, we simply aggregate
the information; otherwise, we just assume that its children are
always valid and use 1 as an estimation.
𝑄[𝑥] :=
(
𝑐(𝑥)
if 𝑐(𝑥) = 0 or 𝑥is new;
Í
𝑢𝑃(𝑢|𝑥)𝑄[𝑥:: [𝑢]]
if 𝑐(𝑥) = 1 and 𝑥is old.
(2)
We use 𝑃𝑄(·) to denote the distribution of 𝑃(·|𝑐) estimated with 𝑄,
𝑃𝑄(𝑠𝑖|𝑠<𝑖) ∝𝑃(𝑠𝑖|𝑠<𝑖)𝑄[𝑠<𝑖:: [𝑠𝑖]].
(3)
For every prefix 𝑥we have encountered during decoding, we
maintain a next token 𝑁[𝑥] sampled from 𝑃𝑄(·|𝑥), where 𝑁is an
associative array. We can concatenate all the next token samples to
get a sample from 𝑃𝑄(·), as shown in algorithm 1.
Our decoding process first samples a prefix 𝑠from 𝑃𝑄(·) as in-
dicated by 𝑁. If it is a complete sequence, we can just return it.
Otherwise, we call the constrainer for every possible next token and
record their information in 𝑄accordingly. We sample 𝑁[𝑠] from all
the valid next tokens by their probability from the language model
(the same distribution as 𝑃𝑄(·|𝑠)). We update 𝑄[𝑥] for all prefixes
𝑥of the sequence 𝑠and decide whether we want to backtrack at
this prefix by updating the prefix’s next token 𝑁[𝑥].

7: end procedure
The estimated validity 𝑄[𝑥:: [𝑁[𝑥]]] of the current next token
𝑁[𝑥] decreases during the update because we always overestimate
the validity. This reduces the probability of drawing 𝑁[𝑥] from
𝑃𝑄(·|𝑥), as shown in formula 3. We decide whether we continue
to use 𝑁[𝑥] as the sample from the updated 𝑃𝑄(·|𝑥) by rejection
sampling. Denote 𝑄before updating as 𝑄, and that after updat-
ing as 𝑄′. We sample a Bernoulli distribution with the probability
of 𝑃𝑄′ (𝑁[𝑥]|𝑥)/𝑃𝑄(𝑁[𝑥]|𝑥) to keep the current next token 𝑁[𝑥]
unchanged, and otherwise change to other tokens 1. If we change
to another next token, which means backtracking occurs, we
sample a new next token from all other tokens with probability
𝑃𝑄(·|𝑐,𝑥), but we explicitly exclude the old 𝑛:= 𝑁[𝑥].

The proof of AdapTrack
AdapTrack focuses on not distorting the model distribution under
constraint and, therefore, not distorting its output intent. We now
give a proof of this statement.
Theorem 5.1. Algorithm 2 only returns a valid complete sequence,
and the probability of generating different sequences that have been
explored during decoding satisfies equation 1.
Proof. The only return statement is step 7, so the returned
sequence is always complete. Also, the returned sequence is col-
lected from 𝑁, where 𝑁[𝑥] ∼𝑃𝑄(·|𝑥) ∝𝑃(·|𝑥)𝑄[𝑥:: [·]] always
guarantees that 𝑁[𝑥] is a valid subsequent token for any prefix 𝑥,
so the algorithm always returns valid well-ended sequences.
Collecting one sample sequence from 𝑁is equivalent to sampling
a result from 𝑃𝑄(·) because we always maintain this property in
the algorithm by rejection sampling, as shown in theorem 5.2.

Theorem 5.2. The update process of 𝑁in steps 11 to 19 in algo-

Proof. We give a proof by induction on the update of 𝑁[𝑥].
Base case. In step 9, 𝑁[𝑥] is drawn from 𝑃𝑄(·|𝑥).
Induction step. When the distribution 𝑄[𝑥] is updated in step 10,
denote the original 𝑁[𝑥] by 𝑛.
By rejection sampling with an acceptance rate of 𝑃𝑄′ (𝑛|𝑥)/𝑃𝑄(𝑛|𝑥) ≤
1, the total probability of generating 𝑛as a sample after the prefix
𝑥is as follows.
𝑃𝑄(𝑛|𝑥) × 𝑃𝑄′ (𝑛|𝑥)
𝑃𝑄(𝑛|𝑥) = 𝑃𝑄′ (𝑛|𝑥).
The probability of generating another token 𝑛′ ≠𝑛as a sample
after the prefix 𝑥is as follows.

Evaluation
We have proven AdapTrack aligns with the language model in
section 5. In this section, we evaluate AdapTrack against other
decoding methods to answer the following research questions:
RQ1. How does AdapTrack perform in predicting correct and
valid APIs?
RQ2. How does AdapTrack perform in predicting correct and
valid APIs in real-world scenarios?
RQ3. How does AdapTrack perform in general code generation?
RQ4. How does AdapTrack align with the oracle distribution of
language models under constraint?
6.1
RQ1: Performance of AdapTrack in
predicting correct and valid APIs
As the library evolves, it often happens that an old API is transi-
tioned into another new API. If the user has updated their library,
only the new APIs should be used; if not, only the old APIs should
be used. In RQ1, we aim to simulate this scenario. We ask the model
to use the same API with the old and the new versions of the same
library, respectively. The APIs used by the model should not only
have the correct semantics, but also be valid in the correspond-
ing library version. With the new library, the model should adopt
the new API; with the old one, it should stick to the old API.

Dataset. We construct a dataset, TFv1, based on the update from
TensorFlow v1 to v2. We prompt the model to generate an API
unique to v1 in a context where it cannot infer the library ver-
sion and then evaluate its ability to correctly generate the API
in both v1 and v2 settings. The version information is given
to the constrainer, so the constrainer is aware of all the valid
APIs in the setting. To guide the model toward using a specific
API, we explicitly annotate the function as a wrapper, encour-
aging the model to directly forward calls to this API. An exam-
ple is illustrated in Figure 3. For this example, the correct an-
swer is .losses.mean_pairwise_squared_error and .compat.-
v1.losses.mean_pairwise_squared_error for TensorFlow v1 and
v2 settings, respectively.
We collect all legal APIs under TensorFlow 2.16 from the official
TensorFlow website. From them, we filter all APIs starting with
tf.compat.v1. We exclude APIs that have counterparts in v2 based
on the last part of the API name. To avoid interference from classes
and methods, we retain only APIs where all parts of its name start
with a lowercase letter. To avoid interference from subpackages,
we remove all APIs that can be a prefix of another API. Ultimately,
we obtained 419 standalone TensorFlow v1-specific APIs.

Metrics. We use exact match (EM) metrics. We report EM@𝑘
[10],
EM@𝑘:= EProblems

where 𝑛is the sample size, 𝑐is how many samples exactly match
the oracle in 𝑛samples, and 𝑘is in 1, 3, 5, 10, 20. EM@𝑘reflects the
expected value of achieving an exact match within 𝑘attempts.
For each method on each problem in each setting, we sample
one result by greedy decoding and then sample 20 results randomly.
For EM@1, we use the greedy result, and the sample size is 1. For
EM@𝑘where 𝑘> 1, we calculate the metrics from the 20 samples.
Because unconstrained decoding does not depend on the version
information, we reuse the same sampling results and only change
the oracle between the two settings.
Baselines. We compare with two baselines, unconstrained decod-
ing and constrained decoding. Unconstrained decoding is decoding
without a constrainer. At each time step, the next token is sampled
from the model distribution without filtering. Constrained decod-
ing is the decoding method we describe in section 3. At each time
step, the probabilities of invalid tokens are set to 0 in the model
distribution before sampling.
Implementation. For the TensorFlow v2 setting, we use all col-
lected TensorFlow APIs as valid APIs in the constrainer. For Ten-
sorFlow v1 setting, we use all the v1 APIs as valid APIs in the
constrainer, but we remove their additional prefix compat˙v1, to
keep the same syntax as in TensorFlow v1. We implement the Adap-
Track algorithm with PyTorch[6] and Transformers[36] library.
We conduct experiments on a 64-core Intel Xeon machine with 8
NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs.
Models. We conduct experiments on Qwen2.5 Coder 7B[16],
DeepSeek Coder Base 6.7B[14], StarCoder2 7B[25] and CodeLlama
Python 7B[31]. We only use base models in this experiment, be-
cause the task of code completion aligns better with the training
target of the base models than that of the instruct models.
Results. As shown in Table 1, for both TensorFlow v1 and
v2 settings, AdapTrack performs significantly better than
constrained decoding, with an improvement up to 360.87%.
In the TensorFlow v1 setting, Qwen2.5 Coder 7B can already
achieve an EM@1 of 61.58%. If we equip it with a constrainer, the
result can be improved to 66.11%, indicating the model may still
generate some API calls invalid in TensorFlow v1 and eliminated
by the constrainer. But using AdapTrack, the result can be further
improved to 80.19%, indicating that, in roughly 14% cases, the model
considers the oracle as its best candidate under constraint but fails
to generate it, because constrained decoding does not allow the
model to modify already generated tokens. Since AdapTrack does
allow the model to modify them to better express its output intent,
AdapTrack performs significantly better than simple constrained
decoding.
It is more dramatic in TensorFlow v2. Without a constrainer,
Qwen2.5 Coder 7B can only achieve an EM@1 of 7.16%. This result
should be considered together with EM@1 in the TensorFlow v1
environment. For 61.58% cases, the model wants to generate v1-
compliant APIs as the best candidate, and then it cannot generate v2-
compliant APIs by unconstrained decoding. If we add a constrainer,
this result can be improved to 18.38%, because APIs that are invalid
in TensorFlow v2 cannot be generated now.
Now consider the results of AdapTrack. With the help of the con-
strainer to remove invalid APIs, the model can now freely generate
the best remaining option in its candidates, resulting in an EM@1
of 54. 89%, which is an improvement of 198. 70% over the 18. 38%
EM@1 of constrained decoding. This is even better than EM@10
of constrained decoding, further showing the importance of not
distorting the language model’s output intent.

RQ2: Performance of AdapTrack in
real-world API completion
We have found that AdapTrack is extremely effective on tf.-
compat.v1. APIs in RQ1, but the results come from a synthetic
dataset, TFv1. We want to know whether this phenomenon also
occurs in real-world code completion.
Dataset. We collect real usage of such APIs from GitHub. For
every v1 API in TFv1, we search for tf.compat.v1.API(, and col-
lect 46,785 Python files from GitHub. We deduplicate these files
and split each file on the first usage of tf.compat.v1. in code. We
then remove all files that contain tf.compat.v1 in the prefix. If the
suffix does not start with an API call, the file is also removed. After
these cleaning steps, we now obtain 14,237 files. We use the prefix
as the completion prefix and the starting API call in the suffix as
the oracle.
We then calculate the length distribution of the prefixes. We
use the tokenizer of CodeLlama 7B Python to tokenize the prefixes
because it has a relatively small vocabulary of 32,000 tokens, which
makes it easier to overflow the model’s max position after tokeniza-
tion. The average length of the prefixes is 1,624.78 tokens, and 90%
of the prefixes have less than or equal to 3,463.0 tokens. To make
the dataset friendlier to models with smaller context windows, we
remove files whose prefix is longer than 4,096 - 512 = 3,584 tokens.
This gives us 12,883 files. We then randomly pick 1,000 files as the
TFv1Real dataset.
Results. As shown in Table 2, AdapTrack performs signifi-
cantly better than constrained decoding for all models, with
an improvement up to 38.93%.
Take Qwen2.5 Coder 7B as an example. Qwen2.5 Coder 7B can
already correctly generate 21.70%. With a constrainer to eliminate
invalid options, the EM@1 can be further improved to 35.60%, indi-
cating that the model is generating many invalid APIs when not
constrained. With AdapTrack, this result can be further improved
to 49.30%, an improvement of 38.48% compared to the result of
constrained decoding, indicating that in constrained decoding, the
model is forced to generate many suboptimal options that are mis-
aligned with the model’s output intent. The improvement is not
as significant as in the TFv1 dataset. Nevertheless, 49.30% is still a
large improvement.
Similar analysis can be applied to the results of other models,
while the largest improvement, 38.93% compared to constrained
decoding, happens in the results of StarCoder2 7B at EM@1, from
29.80% to 41.40%.
6.3
RQ3: Performance of AdapTrack in general
code generation
In RQ1 and RQ2, we conduct experiments on two API comple-
tion datasets, TFv1 and TFv1Real. Now we want to know whether
AdapTrack is effective in general code generation.
Dataset. We adopt the widely used HumanEval [10] and MBPP
[7] benchmarks. We use a type constrainer [26] to ensure the gen-
erated programs are well-typed. Because the constrainer is only
available for programs written in TypeScript, we use the TypeScript-
translated versions from the MultiPL-E dataset [9].
Metrics. We report pass@𝑘[10], which is given by replaces 𝑐in
equation 5 with how many samples can pass the test.
Sampling strategy. It is too time-consuming to check the validity
of the whole vocabulary after every prefix. We introduce a vari-
ant of top-𝑝(nucleus) sampling [15] to reduce the tokens to be
checked. We check the vocabulary from the most possible token to
the least possible one. After calculating the validity of each token,
we calculate the total probability of known valid tokens, and its
ratio to the total probability of possibly valid tokens (i.e. known
valid tokens + unchecked tokens). Once this ratio exceeds 𝑝, all re-
maining unchecked tokens are considered invalid. In unconstrained
decoding, this sampling strategy naturally becomes the classic top-
𝑝sampling, because the constrainer now considers every token to
be valid.
Implementation. We modify the constrainer to fix several bugs
and speed up the calculation. We open-source the modified package
together with our source code.
We restart generation when the constrainer cannot determine
validity of one token in 60 seconds. Since greedy sampling always
returns the same answer for the same problem, if greedy sampling
is restarted 20 times for the same problem, the sample is considered
empty.
Results. As shown in Table 3, AdapTrack almost always out-
performs constrained decoding, with an improvement of
pass@1 up to 7.84% on HumanEval and 6.42% on MBPP, com-
pared to constrained decoding, indicating that distortion also

widely happens to constrained decoding in general code gen-
eration, which can be fixed by AdapTrack to improve the per-
formance. The only outlier is pass@20 of CodeLlama 7B on Hu-
manEval.
When compared to unconstrained decoding, AdapTrack some-
times performs worse (pass@1 of StarCoder2 7B and CodeLlama 7B
on MBPP). This is due to the constrainer’s limitation. Note that
pass@1 is calculated from the greedy samples. If the greedy samples
of uncontrained decoding can pass the test, it should pass the con-
strainer and be greedily sampled by constrained decoding. However,
in these cases, unconstrained decoding outperforms constrained
one. Nevertheless, AdapTrack can still improve the performance of
constrained decoding by fixing the distribution distortion.
6.4
RQ4: Alignment between AdapTrack and
the oracle distribution
We have conducted experiments on both API completion and code
generation. Now we want to verify the statement that the distri-
bution produced by AdapTrack aligns better with the oracle distri-
bution, as an explanation of the previous results. Some previous
work [27] also focuses on fixing the language model’s probability
in constrained decoding, so we follow their work and duplicate
their experiments on AdapTrack in RQ4.
Datasets. Following previous work [27], we use 4 datasets in
domain-specific languages.
The SLIA (strings with linear integer arithmetic) dataset and
the INV-BV (loop invariant generation with bit-vector arithmetic)
dataset each contain 15 problems from the Syntax-Guided Synthesis
(SyGuS) problems [5]. Given the grammar and specification of a
domain-specific language, the goal is to generate a function that
satisfies the specification using the given grammar. Each problem
comes with its own grammar and logical specification, provided to
the model in the prompt. Each prompt also contains 3 in-context
examples in the form of (Problem, Solution) pairs.
The CP (constituency parsing) dataset contains 6 problems of
constituency parsing[12], i.e., to generate the constituency parse
trees from English sentences. The constrains are used to make sure
that the parentheses in the generated sequence are well-paired.
The binary dataset [27] is specifically designed to demonstrate
this problem. There is only one problem in this dataset that asks the
model to generate a random sequence of 5 bits, but the constraint
only allows 00000 and any 5-bit string that starts with 1. For a
correctly constrained decoding method, the probability to generate
00000 should be roughly 1/17, because there are 17 valid samples,
and they should all have the same probability. But constrained
decoding will give 00000 a much higher probability, roughly 1/2,
because in the first step, there are only 2 valid options, i.e., 0 and 1,
and their probabilities are roughly the same.
Metrics. Following previous work[27], for each problem in the
SLIA, INV-BV and CP datasets, we generate 2000 samples; for the
binary dataset, we generate 100 samples. We use as metrics the
Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between the distribution formed
by the samples and the language model distribution. Lower the KL
divergence, the closer the two distributions. For any distribu-
tion 𝑄that only contains constrained samples, the KL divergence
between 𝑄and 𝑃LM reflects the KL divergence between 𝑄and
𝑃(·|𝑐).

where 𝑍is the normalizing constant in 𝑃(·|𝑐).
It should be noted that these metrics are only meaningful when
compared with results on the same problem because an identical
unknown constant log𝑍has been added to all of them.
For each question, we calculate the average KL divergence be-
tween all the samples and the language model. We also present

Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY
Yongmin Li, Jia Li, Ge Li, and Zhi Jin
the average KL divergence of the four datasets, weighted by the
number of problems in each dataset.
To see how each method converges to the oracle distribution,
we also calculate the KL divergence between a sliding window of
𝑛samples and the language model, where 𝑛is one-fourth of the
sampling size for each problem.
Baselines. We compare with two baselines, constrained decoding
(CD) and Adaptive Sampling with Approximate Expected Futures
(ASAp) [27]. ASAp can be regarded as a variant of AdapTrack,
where after sampling a sequence from 𝑃𝑄, instead of backtracking
and adjusting all the previous sampling results, it just continues to
use the current partially generated prefix. It uses the information
collected in 𝑄only in the later samples on the same problem. To
match its behavior, we also share the estimation data 𝑄between
different generations; only the sample data 𝑁is updated for a new
sample.
Implementation. We reuse ASAp code to replicate their settings
and the same transformers-CFG[12] library for the constrainer.
Models. Following previous work[27], we use the Mistral-7B[17]
model for all decoding algorithms.

Results. As shown in Table 4, in all four datasets, AdapTrack
performs significantly better than both constrained decoding
and ASAp. In both the SLIA and CP datasets, constrained decod-
ing and ASAp perform roughly the same, while AdapTrack has a
large advantage. In the INV-BV dataset, all three methods perform
roughly the same. This might indicate that the portion of illegal
tokens on different tokens in this dataset is roughly the same, so
constrained decoding can perform roughly the same as AdapTrack.
The binary dataset is the only dataset where ASAp performs much
better than constrained decoding, while AdapTrack still has some
advantage over ASAp.

Figure 4 shows how the KL divergence evolves in repeated sam-
pling. The point with the abscissa 𝑥in the figure represents the
KL divergence between the distribution formed by the 𝑥th to the
(𝑛+ 𝑥)th samples and the model distribution.
With more and more information stored in 𝑄, decoding
results of AdapTrack become better and better. On the SLIA,
CP and binary dataset, AdapTrack has a low KL divergence from the
start and continues to be low for the entire generation, indicating
that AdapTrack has already found a good distribution from the
first one-fourth samples. On the INV-BV dataset, the KL divergence
of AdapTrack declines greatly, indicating that AdapTrack is still
learning new things in repeated sampling.

Robustness analysis
7.1.1
Temperature. Performance of decoding method often de-
pends on the sampling temperature. In previous RQs, the tempera-
ture is always 1. Therefore, we conduct experiments to see how the
performance of AdapTrack changes with different sampling tem-
peratures, i.e. 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9. The experiments
are conducted with best-performing models on TFv1 and TFv1Real,
i.e. CodeLlama Python 7B and Qwen2.5 Coder 7B, respecitively.

Figure 5: The change of EM@𝑘in different temperature.
As shown in figure 5, under temperatures from 0.0 to 1.0, for
EM@𝑘where 𝑘∈{1, 3, 5, 10, 20}, AdapTrack always outperforms
both constrained and unconstrained decoding. As the temperature
increases, the performance of all methods increases, because ap-
propriately higher temperature encourages the model to explore
answers in a larger range, and EM@𝑘is 1 if any of the 𝑘attempts
hits the correct answer, except for EM@1, where greedy sampling
always gives the same result.
7.1.2
Model size. Performance of decoding method often depends
on the model size. Some methods only work with small models or
large models. In previous RQs, we always experiment with models
sized roughly 7B. Therefore, we conduct experiments to see how the
performance of AdapTrack changes with differently sized models.
The experiments are conducted with Qwen2.5 Coder series (0.5B,
1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B) on TFv1 and TFv1Real datasets, because
Qwen2.5 Coder series provide a balanced and various range of
choices for model sizes. To reduce needed GPU memory, for models
larger than 7B, we use the bfloat16 format during inference.
As shown in figure 6, under all different model sizes, on both
TFv1 and TFv1Real datasets, AdapTrack always outperforms both
constrained decoding and unconstrained decoding. As the model
size increases, the performance of all methods on TFv1 is saturated
or even decreases after a certain threshold. One possible reason is
that TFv1 is synthetic and too simple, so the difference in model
size does not influence the result. As the model size increases, all

7.2
Efficiency and scalability of AdapTrack
One might concern the efficiency and scalability of AdapTrack from
two perspectives: (1) updating 𝑄and 𝑁from step 10 to step 19 in
algorithm 2 can be inefficient; (2) AdapTrack may need too much
time before generating a complete sequence.
7.2.1
Parallel update. The update of 𝑄and 𝑁can be parallelized
on GPU, rather than performed token by token. If 𝑄[𝑥] is updated
from 1 to 𝑞, where 𝑥becomes an old prefix during the update, if
𝑥= Concat(𝑠,𝑥′), following formula can be used to update 𝑄[𝑠],
𝑄[𝑠] ←𝑄[𝑠] −𝑃LM(𝑥′|𝑠)(1 −𝑞),
where 𝑃LM(𝑥′|𝑠) can be computed in parallel for all prefix 𝑠of 𝑥.It is
then natural to compute the updated 𝑃𝑄(·|𝑠) in parallel, and perform
the rejection sampling needed. It should be noted that the rejection
sampling and the sampling after rejection can also be fused into
one sampling, further reducing branching in the calculation.
7.2.2
Number of LM calls. The most computationally intensive
part of the decoding process is the invocation of the language
model. We count the number of calls to the language model per
sample in the RQ1 experiments, as shown in Table 5. In the Tensor-
Flow v1 setting, AdapTrack invokes the language model on average
20% more frequently than constrained decoding, whereas, in the
TensorFlow v2 setting, this number rises to an average of 60% more
calls than constrained decoding. Similar numbers also apply to
the averaged maximum number of calls to LM. Considering that
EM@1 of AdapTrack is often comparable to EM@5 of constrained
decoding, this level of increase in the number of invocations can
be justified.
If theoretical completeness is sacrificed, we can take additional
constraints on AdapTrack to avoid extremely long backtracking dis-
tances. For example, a lower bound can be set for the backtracking
probability, prohibiting backtracking if the probability falls below
this threshold. An upper limit can also be set for the backtracking
distance, disallowing backtracking beyond this specified maximum.
In particular, as shown in Figure 7, we conduct experiments with
limited backtracking distances (including 1, 2, 4, 8) with CodeLlama
Python 7B on TFv1 and Qwen2.5 Coder 7B on TFv1Real, respec-
tively. For both models and datasets, the performance increases as
the allowed backtracking distance increases, but stops increasing
after a certain threshold. From the figure, we can see that a back-
tracking distance of 2 or 4 is roughly enough for TFv1 (v1 settings),
4 or 8 for TFv1 (v2 settings), and 2 for TFv1Real. This indicates that

7.3
Threats to validity
7.3.1
Dataset selection. The first threat lies in the selection of
dataset: Does this problem of constrained decoding happen only
in deprecated APIs or only in API completion? We mitigate this
threat by experiments in RQ1 where we ask the model to gener-
ate a TensorFlow v1 API in a TensorFlow v1 setting, where these
APIs are not considered deprecated, which can be fixed by Adap-
Track to provide significant improvement. Experiments on general
code generation benchmarks in RQ3 show that such distortion also
happens in general code generation, and AdapTrack can provide
performance improvement by fixing such distortion.
7.3.2
Model selection. The second threat lies in the selection of
the models: Is this issue due to the limitation in model’s capability?
We mitigate this threat by using multiple models in experiments,
and using differently-sized models in robustness analysis. Although
they have different capabilities, AdapTrack shows a consistent im-
provement. It should be noted that this is an inherent problem of
constrained decoding. As long as constrained decoding is employed,
the problem will persist to some extent.

8.1
API-aware code generation
APIs evolve over time, and code LLMs need to handle that. CERT[38]
introduces a sketcher to predict the sketch of API usage, and then
uses a generator to use the API in the relevant context. Toolcoder[39]
introduces an API search tool to help the model search for wanted
APIs. Wang et al. [34] conduct the first evaluation study on the usage
of deprecated APIs in LLM-based code completion. VersiCode[37]
dataset focuses on version-specific code completion and version-
aware code migration. CodeUpdateArena[24] dataset constructs
synthetic API function update to evaluate LLM’s ability to handle
API update.
8.2
Constrained decoding in code generation
Constrained decoding is a greedy method to ensure the generated
sequence statisfy certain constraints. Picard [32] and Synchromesh
[29] introduce incremental parser into code generation to help
the model reject inadmissible tokens at each decoding step. Later
grammar-based constrainers [8, 11, 21, 28] focus on the acceleration
of constraint calculation. Monitor-guided decoding [3] and Repilot
[35] introduce constrained decoding in the generation of general-
purpose programming languages, by communicating with static
analysis tools in IDEs, e.g., language servers in Visual Studio Code,
to collect information about the whole repository to help API gen-
eration. Mündler et al. [26] introduce type system into constrained
decoding, ensuring the generated program to be type-safe.
8.3
Fixing greedy constrained decoding
Naïve greedy constrained decoding is known to be problematic,
and there are some work trying to fix that. GeDi[22] introduces
another trained model to model the expected validity of each prefix,
but training another model is a large overhead. ASAp[27] samples
multiple sequences from the language model and use the validity
information from previous samples to direct future sampling. This
can be regarded as a variant of AdapTrack without backtracking.
Gen-C[4] models the constraint with constraint circuits and resam-
ples using the pseudolikelihood in the neighborhood of a sentence,
but constraint circuits are only constructible for regular expressions
and, therefore, unsuitable for code generation.
8.4
Non-linear code generation techniques
Non-linear code generation techniques is not unheard of. PG-TD
[40] uses Monte-Carlo tree search, and executes public test cases to
determine the quality of generated code. Rocode [19] detects errors
after generating every statement by running static analysis tools
and executing public test cases, and rollbacks to the statement of the
error report or earlier statements with high generation uncertainty.
However, these methods are not designed to address distribution
distortion and consequently still produce distorted distributions,
while AdapTrack specifically targets this issue and provides prov-
ably undistorted results. These methods often use public test cases
to filter out incorrect programs, but, while possible, similar pro-
cedure is not executed in AdapTrack, because AdapTrack focuses
more on the distribution distortion problem.
9
Conclusion and future work
In this work, we propose a new decoding method, AdapTrack, to
fix the distribution distortion problem in constrained decoding by
introducing backtracking that is adaptive to the invalidated prob-
ability mass into the generation process. We collect two datasets,
the synthetic TFv1 dataset and the real-world TFv1Real dataset to
verify the effectiveness of AdapTrack. Experiments on general code
generation benchmarks verifies the generalizability of AdapTrack.
We give theoretical proof of our method that it does follow the out-
put intent of the model and conduct experiments on DSL problems
to verify that.
In the future, we will explore this phenomenon on more APIs,
and explore how to help the model align better with the constraints.
